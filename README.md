# clj-bom



## What

A tiny (100 LOC) Clojure library designed to help you deal with BOMs (Byte-Order-Marks) in text-based files.

## Where 

TODO: add clojars link

## Why 

The purpose of BOMs is to signal the encoding of the characters to follow in the stream. For instance when you create a .csv file in Excel it will probably save it with the UTF-8 (by default) BOM. Opening that same file with Excel is no problem because Excel is able to detect BOMs. If you, however, try to read that csv programmatically, you will find that the first word of the file is read with an extra leading (non-printable) character. Depending on what you actually do with the csv, this may not be a problem. But it could also be a major problem. Say for example that you use `clojure.data.csv` to read that file into a list of maps. Each map contains [column-name value] entries. In the presence of a BOM, there will always be one column (the first one as they were read in) which you won't be able to lookup with its printable name (what you see on the screen). So the column might be called `foo`, but you won't be able to do `(get % "foo")`. That's obviously a problem, and it can lead to spurious bugs.


## How

The API consists mainly of two functions. These are `bom-reader` and `bom-writer`.

### bom-reader

Takes anything compatible with `io/input-stream` (presumably starts with a BOM) and returns a Reader with the correct encoding set, and the first character skipped. In the absence of a BOM, this is equivalent with calling `io/reader` on the InputStream (without options).

```clj
(require '[clj-bom :as bom] 
         '[clojure.data.csv :as csv])

(with-open [reader (bom/bom-reader "in-file-with-BOM.csv")]
  (doall (csv/read-csv reader)))
```


### bom-writer
 
Takes an OutputStream and returns a Writer (with the correct encoding) which will write the specified BOM before anything else.

```clj
(require '[clj-bom :as bom]
         '[clojure.data.csv :as csv])

(with-open [writer (bom/bom-writer bom/utf8-BOM "out-file-with-BOM.csv")]
  (csv/write-csv writer
                 [["abc" "def"]
                 ["ghi" "jkl"]]))
```

A couple of more helpers are available (e.g. `has-bom?` variants) but I'm not super convinced of their utility, so will probably removing them soon.


## Alternatives 
If you already have `apache.commons.io` in your stack then I guess `BOMInputStream` is the closest thing to what I'm trying to do here.
